## zenData

zenData or ft_db is a small relational database written from the ground up in C.

The data base is designed to use a dual binary tree system in which there is a 
tree that is traversed to find a specific table, once found the 'data' for that node
contains the second tree filled with that table's features.

The database has a method for viewing all of its tables, deleteing whole tables or
specific entries, and also exporting to CSV.

This was a sprint project written in 3 weeks with my partner Keenan Romain (https://github.com/keenanromain).
