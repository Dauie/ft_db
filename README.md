## zenData

The database is designed to use a dual binary tree system in which there is a 
tree that is traversed to find a specific table, once found the 'data' for that 
node contains the second tree filled with that table's features.

The database has a method for viewing all of its tables, deleting whole 
tables or specific entries, and also exporting to CSV.

This was a sprint project written in 3 weeks with my 
partner Keenan Romain (https://github.com/keenanromain).
